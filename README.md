**My exercise repository for Design Guru's Grokking the Coding Interview course (www.designgurus.org)**. I utilized this course to get faster at recognizing patterns and solutions during coding assessments. This course includes overviews and problems for the following patterns:

1. Sliding Window - Complete

2. Two Pointers -- Complete

3. Fast and Slow Pointers (Hare and Tortoise) - Complete

4. Merge Intervals

5. Cyclic Sort

6. In-place Reversal of Linked List

7. Tree Breadth First Search

8. Tree Depth First Search

9. Two Heaps

10. Subsets

11. Modified Binary Search

12. Bitwise XOR

13. Top K Elements

14. K-way Merge

15. 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)

16. Topological Sort (Graphs)
