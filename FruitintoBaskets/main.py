"""
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits
in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one
type of fruit.
You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop
when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
